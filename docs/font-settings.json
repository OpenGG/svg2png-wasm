{"body":"> If you want to use text in SVG, you need to check this section.\n\n> We are aware that this API is not easy to understand and we will improve it, so please pay attention to future API changes.\n\nWebAssembly is run in a sandbox for safety reasons. Therefore, WebAssembly does not have access to system information, for example, it cannot use the system fonts.\n\nFor this reason, svg2png-wasm passes the font externally when you want to use text in SVG.\n\n### Example\n\n```js\nconst robotoFont = await fetch('/assets/Roboto.ttf').then((res) =>\n  res.arrayBuffer(),\n);\nconst png = await svg2png(svgData, {\n  fonts: [new Uint8Array(robotoFont)],\n  defaultFontFamily: {\n    sansSerifFamily: 'Roboto',\n  },\n});\n```\n","metadata":{"slug":"font-settings","title":"Font Settings"}}
